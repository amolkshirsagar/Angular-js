<h2 id ="html">HTML Basics</h2>

<p>
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.<br>
    Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br>
    As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.<br>
    Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.<br>
    Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.

    Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.<br>
    JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.<br>
    The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

<a href="" ng-click="Top()">Back To Top</a>
<p>
    AngularJS is an open source, JavaScript based web application development framework.<br>
    AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application components clearly and succinctly. Its data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you currently have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.<br>
    It was originally developed in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. It is now maintained by Google.
